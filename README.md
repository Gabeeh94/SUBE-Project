# SUBE personal data scraper and cleaner

A Python scraper that downloads the PDF with all the SUBE's (Buenos Aires's public transportation system) data of a particular person and a script that uses OCR to create a csv from the images. This file is then intended to be used to do some basic analysis and visualizations.
